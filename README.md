# Display mode Icons

**Display mode Icons** plugin adds direct acces to several frequently used display settings to the Art of Illusion user interface.

It adds a set of icons on the tool bar of every view to control view properties. These include Align to axis directions, Perspective, Navigation mode , Grid, Orientation display *(the coordinates symbol)*and Display Mode *(a.k.a. Rendering style)*, with a dedicated icon for each mode. This makes changing settings, while working, much faster than browsing each setting thru application menus. There's also a tool tip text for every icon, explaining what each icon will do.

The plugin also changes the behavior of the View/Diplay Mode-menu selection to affect all views, instead of the the active one, so instead of redundancy you'll have a more powerful tool in the menu and the routinely used tool on the icons.
